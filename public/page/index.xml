      <description>&lt;p&gt;I hold a masterâ€™s degree in Chemical Engineering and Technology from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cqut.edu.cn/&#34;&gt;Chongqing University of Technology&lt;/a&gt;. During my graduate studies, my research on microbial diversity sparked my interest in bioinformatics. As the first student in my lab to explore multi-omics bioinformatics analysis, I had to teach myself everything from the ground up, which was both challenging and rewarding. Although my programming background was limited at first, I gradually built up my skills through persistent self-study.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
